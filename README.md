# UART Brightness Sensor Serial Shell

## Overview
This project provides a **UART-based communication shell** to interact with brightness sensors over **I²C**.  
It captures real-time brightness data, visualizes it dynamically, and logs results into Excel for further analysis.

## Features
- Command-line interface for **USB-UART devices**  
- **I²C integration** with brightness sensor  
- Real-time plotting with **Matplotlib**  
- Automated **Excel data logging** for calibration and reporting  

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, C++  
- **Libraries:** `pyserial`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl`  

## Example Output
- **Dynamic graphs** displaying ambient brightness changes  
- **Excel tables** with timestamped sensor readings  

## Use Cases
- Sensor calibration and validation  
- Hardware/software integration for display driver IC systems  
- Automated data collection for R&D experiments
